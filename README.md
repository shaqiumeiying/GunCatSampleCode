This is a 2d arcade shooting game, where you're the sole survivor of an experimental super soldier program, and when you awaken, you are surrounded by dead clones and failed experiment objects(slimes). By the way, You are also a cat. The city is under attack by monsters and silmes, the military has begun pulling back to initiate Protocol: Scorched Earth, an emergency protocol to completely destroy the city.

Since this is a group project, each of us has contributed equally by taking responsibility for different aspects of the game. For my part, I developed the rendering systems, menu, and HUD using OpenGL and C++. Additionally, I created a wide variety of unique assets using Aseprite â€” everything you see in the game is hand-drawn by me!
